            <h1>Purpose of Project</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a web application that is 
             intended to be functional and purposeful. This application incorporates 
             various features that have been covered in class such as text, links, buttons, photos, and color. 
            </p>
            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p>The web application is meant to be a home page for various National Parks around the country. 
            We included a layout page for each park with brief descriptions and links to the parksâ€™ official home page. 
            In order to build this web application we researched the parks that we choose to include 
            and then built a series of html files to create the web pages. There is a menu that navigates the user 
            to each page and on each page there is pictures and descriptions of the park.</p>
            <h1>Theoretical Background</h1>
            <p>For this project, we used the knowledge gained from class in order to create the web application. 
            Our goal with the topic of National Parks was to show how Computer Science can bridge the gap between 
            two very different topics: technology and the outdoors.</p>
