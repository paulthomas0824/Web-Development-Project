        <h1>Purpose of Project</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to create a web application that is 
          intended to be functional and purposeful. This application will incorporate 
          various features that have been covered in class such as text, links, buttons, photos, and color. 
          We hope that in creation of this web application we learn new features and topics that we can use in the future.</p>
        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <p>The web application will be a home page for various National Parks around the country. 
            We plan to include a layout page for each park with brief descriptions and links to the parkâ€™s official main page. 
	In order to build this web application we will research about the parks that we choose to include 
        and then build a series of html files to create the web pages. Ideally, there will be a menu that navigates the user 
        to each page and on each page there will be pictures of the park with text giving descriptions of the park.</p>
        <h1>Theoretical Background</h1>
        <p>For this project, we will use the knowledge gained from class in order to create the web application. 
            Our goal with the topic of National Parks is to show how Computer Science can bridge the gap between 
            two very different topics: technology and the outdoors.</p>
